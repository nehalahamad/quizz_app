        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The syntax \"function sum(int a, int b) => a + b;\" is a valid way to define a function in Dart. It is called an arrow function, and it is a shorthand way to define a function that returns a single expression."

        "D": "Compilation error",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The code uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the \"numbers\" list. If the current number is even, the \"continue\" keyword is used to skip the remaining statements in the loop and move on to the next iteration. Therefore, only the odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) will be printed."

        "D": "Compilation error",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The code uses a while loop to print the value of the variable \"x\" while it is greater than 0. The value of \"x\" starts at 5, and it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output of the program will be \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1\"."

        "D": "Compilation error",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The code uses a do-while loop to print the value of the variable \"x\" while it is greater than 0. The value of \"x\" starts at 10, and it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The do-while loop guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, even if the condition is false. Therefore, the output of the program will be \"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\"."

        "C": "['banana', 'cherry', 'durian']",
        "D": "Compilation error",
        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "The code declares a list of strings named \"fruits\" and initializes it with four values. The \"removeAt\" method is then called with an index of 1 to remove the second element of the list (which is \"banana\"). Finally, the \"print\" method is called to display the updated list. Therefore, the output of the program will be \"['apple', 'cherry', 'durian']\"."

Finally, the \"print\" method is called to display the updated list, which is now empty. Therefore, the output of the program will be \"[]\"."
